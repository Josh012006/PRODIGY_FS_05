## About the project
The project is a social media platform. It implements complex operations and relationships between models.

## How it works
Like any basic social media app, the users can create profile and connect to the app. Then, they have access to all the recent users' posts. They can like posts, comment them and even like the comments. There is an integration of emojis and stories for the users.

They can themselves add posts, follow other users and have followers. They can see another user's profile page with its username (that is unique) and its bio. On their on profile, they can change their infos, their profile picture and their story or decide to logout.
